# Merchant Sheet NPC

This module adds an additional NPC sheet which can be used for Merchant NPCs. 

This version was forked from ChalkOne's module which ended compatibility with Foundry VTT version 0.7.9 (https://github.com/jopeek/fvtt-loot-sheet-npc-5e). This fork should be updated by me to keep it current with Foundry VTT.

### Features

Allows for easy making a shopkeeper that can be displayed to the players. 

More features detailed below.

##### Shopkeeper Sheet
Can be used to create an inventory of a shopkeeper to allow players to buy from their inventory. Prices are listed next to each item.
